	<h1>Target Audience</h1>
		<p>Slammers Volleyball has identified the current member base to be 35-50, However, Slammers Volleyball want to attract a younger audience, 15-30 year olds, young families and their highschool age children. To capture this younger demographic the design will feature bright funky colors and interfaces optimised for mobile devices. The new design must scream Fun, Excitment, Happening.</p>
